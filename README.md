miscellaneous scripts  

###freen  
  This parses the pbsnodes output and creates a table with interesting information from the pbsnodes output.  
  it should be very easy to customize this to run on any cluster running PBS  


###jobload  
  return the qstat -q output in a tabular format.  
  bare qstat does not give much information and this parser is very useful in job monitoring.  


###[swarm](https://hpc.nih.gov/apps/swarm.html)  
  This is a simplistic version of the sophisticated swarm developed at NIH Biowulf.
